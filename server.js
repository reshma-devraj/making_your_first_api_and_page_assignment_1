// Boilerplate Code for Virtual Assistant API
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

/*
Task:
You need to build an API for a virtual assistant that provides customized responses.

Requirements:
1. Create a GET endpoint at "/assistant/greet".
2. The endpoint should accept a "name" as a query parameter (e.g., /assistant/greet?name=John).
3. The API should return a JSON response with:
   a. A personalized greeting using the name provided.
   b. A cheerful message based on the current day of the week.

Example Responses:
- For Monday:
  {
    "welcomeMessage": "Hello, John! Welcome to our assistant app!",
    "dayMessage": "Happy Monday! Start your week with energy!"
  }
- For Friday:
  {
    "welcomeMessage": "Hello, John! Welcome to our assistant app!",
    "dayMessage": "It's Friday! The weekend is near!"
  }
- For other days:
  {
    "welcomeMessage": "Hello, John! Welcome to our assistant app!",
    "dayMessage": "Have a wonderful day!"
  }

Add the required logic below to complete the API.
*/
// Endpoint to greet the user
app.get('/assistant/greet', (req, res) => {
  const userName = req.query.name;

  // Check if the name parameter is provided
  if (!userName) {
    return res.status(400).json({ error: "Name is required as a query parameter." });
  }

  // Get the current day of the week
  const daysOfWeek = [
    "Sunday",
    "Monday",
    "Tuesday",
    "Wednesday",
    "Thursday",
    "Friday",
    "Saturday"
  ];
  const currentDay = daysOfWeek[new Date().getDay()];

  // Messages based on the day
  let dayMessage = "Have a wonderful day!";
  if (currentDay === "Monday") {
    dayMessage = "Happy Monday! Start your week with energy!";
  } else if (currentDay === "Friday") {
    dayMessage = "It's Friday! The weekend is near!";
  }

  // Respond with just the plain text
  res.send(`${"Hello, " + userName}! ${dayMessage}`);
});



const PORT = 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Virtual Assistant API is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
